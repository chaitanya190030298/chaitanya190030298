<h1>About Social medial</h1>
    <img src="img.jpg" alt="My test image">
<p>Social media are interactive technologies that allow the creation or sharing/exchange of information</p> 
<p>ideas, career interests, and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks</p>
<p>What makes social media unique is that it is both broad and relatively uncensored. While many social media companies impose</p>
<p> some limitations—such as taking down images that display violence or nudity—there are much fewer limitations on</p>
<p> what someone can share than there with other means of mass communication like newspapers, radio stations, and television channels.</p>
